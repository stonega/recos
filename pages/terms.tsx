        <p>
          Capitalized terms not defined in these Terms of Service shall have the

        <h2>1. OUR SERVICES AND USERS.</h2>
        <p>
          The Services translate and transcribe videos and other content from
          social media platforms or other user generated content in up to 99
          different languages, which can then be uploaded to the social media
          platforms or hosted on the Platform.
        </p>
        <p>Our Services have several types of users:</p>
        <ol>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Visitors. Visitors to our Site, as the term implies, are people
              who do not register for an account, but want to explore the Site
              for informational purposes. No login is required for visitors to
              the Site. Visitors can access all publicly-available content and
              features of the Site, and can contact us using the contact link on
              the Site.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Registered Users and Accounts. In order to use the Services, you
              must establish an account with us. Recos is under no obligation to
              accept any individual or entity as an account holder, and may
              accept or reject any registration in our sole and complete
              discretion. Visitors who register an account with us will be
              referred to as “Users” in these Terms of Service.

        </ol>
        <p>
          To create an account, you or your authorized representative will be
          prompted to create a password and user name (“Recos User ID”) and
          perhaps provide certain additional information that will assist in
          authenticating your identity when you log-in in the future
          (collectively “Login Credentials”). You may not transfer your account
          to anyone else without our prior written permission. When creating
          your account, you must provide true, accurate, current, and complete
          information about yourself. Each Recos User ID and corresponding
          password can be used by only one individual. You are responsible for
          maintaining the confidentiality of your account Login Credentials. You
          are fully responsible for all activities that are associated with your

          Services, or communications from your account to Recos). You agree to
          immediately notify us of any unauthorized use or suspected
          unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security.

        <h2>3. USER CONTENT; LICENSES.</h2>
        <p>
          The Services allow Users to post, send via chat, and upload content
          such as photos, videos, images, text, graphics, and other materials
          (collectively, “User Content”) for translation and transcription
          purposes.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          You retain all copyrights and other intellectual property rights in
          and to your own User Content. You do, however, hereby grant us and our
          sublicensees a non-exclusive, royalty-free, freely sublicensable,
          perpetual, irrevocable license to modify, compile, combine with other
          content, copy, record, synchronize, transmit, translate, transcribe,

          all intellectual property and moral rights therein throughout the
          universe, in each case, by or in any means, methods, media, or
          technology now known or hereafter devised. Recos will own all rights,
          including all intellectual property rights, in any translated,
          transcribed, adapted or otherwise derived media it creates from your
          User Content (“Translated Content”).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If you submit User Content to us, each such submission constitutes a
          representation and warranty to Recos that (i) you have received all
          necessary releases and consent from all individuals that appear in the
          User Content, and (ii) such User Content is your original creation (or
          that you otherwise have the right to provide the User Content), that
          you have the rights necessary to grant the license to the User Content
          under the prior paragraph, and that the User Content and its use by
          Recos and our content partners as permitted by this Agreement does not
          and will not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the
          intellectual property rights, moral rights, or rights of privacy or
          publicity of any person, or contain any libelous, defamatory, or
          obscene material or content that violates the Agreement. You agree to
          defend, indemnify, and hold us, our affiliates, and our and their
          respective owners, members, officers, directors, employees, agents,
          successors, licensees, licensors, and assigns harmless from and
          against any damages, liabilities, losses, expenses, claims, actions,
          and/or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and
          accounting fees, arising or resulting from your breach of the
          representations and warranties in this paragraph.

        <h2>4. PURCHASE TERMS.</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Service Types. A User can access the free version of the Platform to
            begin using the Services. To have access to all the features of the
            Platform, Recos offers a monthly subscription service to the Premium
            version of the Platform (“Subscription”) for a fee set forth on the
            Site (the “Subscription Fee”). Recos may add new fees and charges,
            or amend fees and charges, at any time in its sole discretion. Recos
            will seek to notify you by reasonable means of any material increase
            in such fee.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fees. Users shall pay all Subscription Fees. Payment is due
            immediately upon making a purchase of the Subscription.&nbsp;
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>
          {" "}
          By purchasing a Subscription, User acknowledges that User’s
          Subscription has an initial and recurring payment charge at the
          then-current Subscription rate, User agrees that Recos may submit
          monthly charges, in advance to User’s chosen payment method without
          further authorization from User, until User provide notice to Recos
          that User wishes to cancel User’s Subscription or to change User’s
          payment method. User further accepts responsibility for all recurring
          charges prior to cancellation, including, where applicable, any
          charges processed by Recos after the expiration date of your payment
          card.
        </h3>
        <p>
          User may change or terminate User’s Subscription by emailing us at
          legal@Recos.video If User terminates User’s Subscription, User may use
          User’s Subscription until the end of the then-current billing cycle,
          and the Subscription will not be renewed after that period expires.
          Recos does not refund any pre-paid portion of the Subscription fee.
          Recos may immediately terminate or suspend User’s Subscription for any
          reason or no reason in accordance with these Terms of Service. If we
          terminate or suspend User’s Subscription, User’s license to use any
          software or content provided in connection with the Subscription is
          also terminated or suspended (as applicable).

        <h2>12. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.</h2>

          The Services are based in the United States. We make no claims

          the laws of your specific jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <h2>13. CONTROLLING LAW</h2>
        <p>
          This Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed by the
          laws of the [State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws
          provisions.
        </p>
        <h2>14. BINDING ARBITRATION.</h2>
        <p>
          In the event of a dispute arising between you and Recos under or
          relating to this Agreement or the Services (each, a “Dispute”), such
          Dispute will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding
          arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). Any
          election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the
          other party. IF EITHER YOU OR Recos CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY
          SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY
          TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL
          CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF
          WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT,
          AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
          All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected
          jointly by you and Recos, whose decision will be final, except for a
          limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be
          commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current
          Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with
          the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate,
          pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All
          applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures are available at the JAMS
          website <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a>. Each of
          you and Recos will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing,
          administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules.
          Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having
          jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking
          provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate
          jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
          submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person,
          the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you
          reside. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to
          stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate,
          or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The parties
          shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange
          of all non-privileged documents and other information (including
          electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately
          after commencement of the arbitration. As set forth in Section 20
          below, nothing in this Agreement will prevent us from seeking
          injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary
          to protect our proprietary interests.
        </p>
        <h2>15. CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h2>
        <p>
          You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the
          Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted
          by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any
          other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
          arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class
          action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any
          Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf
          of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY
          BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A
          PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
          PROCEEDING.
        </p>
        <h2>16. EQUITABLE RELIEF.</h2>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened
          violation of our intellectual property rights and confidential and
          proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and
          will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this
          Agreement. We may, without waiving any other remedies under this
          Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim,
          equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is necessary to
          protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration
          referenced above. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent
          to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the federal and
          state courts in Los Angeles, California for purposes of any such
          action by us.
        </p>
        <h2>17. EXTERNAL SITES.</h2>
        <p>
          The Services may contain links to third-party websites (“External
          Sites”). These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and
          not as an endorsement by us of the content on such External Sites. The

        <h2>19. GENERAL.</h2>
        <p>
          No failure or delay by Recos in exercising any right or remedy under
          the Agreement will operate, or be deemed to operate, as a waiver of
          any such right or remedy. If any provision of the Agreement is found
          invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that
          provision will be amended and the remainder of the Agreement will
          remain in full force and effect. The Agreement constitutes the final
          and complete agreement between you and Recos regarding the subject
          matter hereof, and supersede any prior or contemporaneous
          communications, representations, or agreements between us, whether
          oral or written, including, without limitation, any confidentiality or
          non-disclosure agreements. Headings are for convenience only and shall
          not be used to limit or interpret the meaning of any of the provisions
          of the Agreement. Terms which by their nature are intended to survive
          indefinitely shall survive and shall apply to you even if you have
          canceled your account or stopped using the Services, including,
          without limitation, the limitations of liability, indemnity, and
          dispute resolution provisions.
